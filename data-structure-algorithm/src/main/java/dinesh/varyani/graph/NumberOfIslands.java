/**
 * In this problem, we are given an m x n 2D binary grid,
 * which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water).
 * We need to return the number of islands.
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
 * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
