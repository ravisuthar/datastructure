 * In this problem we are given an array of integers nums,
 * there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right.
 * You can only see the k numbers in the window.
 * Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.
 * Return the max sliding window.
 *
 * 44 77 33 44 88 11 k=3
 *
 * explanation: 44 77 33  is 77
 * 77 33 77 is 77
 * 33 44 88 is 88
 * 44 88 11 is 88
 *
 * max sliding windows is 77 77 88  88
